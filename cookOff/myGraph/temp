Given a time in hours and minutes, find the angle between hours and minutes pointers in analog clock.
Given two arrays of equal size. First Array represents in the arrival timings of trains and second array represents the departure timings of the same trains.

Given an array containing integers, in which the elements are repeated multiple times.
Now sort the array wrt the frequency of numbers.

eg:	i/p: 2, 4, 5, 2, 1, 9, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5
	o/p: 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 4, 3, 9

 -write program to calculate power(x,n) in log(n) time
  -Given an array, which contains integers in the range of 1 to n. one number is missing from it and one number is repeated in array. for ex -- array is {1,2,3,4,4,6,7,8,9} , range given is 1- n(n=9).
   -Puzzle- Find minimum floor from which a tt ball will break, if there are 100 floor and 2 tt balls
    -  Find one/twomissing number in 1-n numbers
  -  Develop and run a program which has 2 arrays of any length with a set of negative,zero and positive numbers and a sum was provided. In the complexity o(n) identify the indexes of both the arrays whose sum of values form the given sum.   
- Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element.
 -Given two sorted arrays of integers, A and B, find the set of n largest numbers where each number is the sum of an integer from A and an integer from B.
