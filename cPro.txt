At ShareChat, there are are plenty of interesting problems to solve. Here is one of them.

Given integers A, B and N, you should calculate the GCD of AN+BN and |A−B|. (Assume that GCD(0,a)=a for any positive integer a). 
Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).

Explanation

Example case 1: GCD(101+11,10−1)=GCD(11,9)=1

Example case 2: GCD(95+15,9−1)=GCD(59050,8)=2




















The structure of the company ShareChat can be described by a simple graph (without multiedges and self-loops) 
with N vertices numbered 1 through N and M edges numbered 1 through M. 
Each vertex of this graph is part of at most one simple cycle.

For each edge, you should find the number of simple paths that contain this edge 
and only contain at most one edge which belongs to a cycle.
Input

    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
    The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers Nand M
.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v, 
denoting the vertices connected by edge i

Output

For each test case, print M
lines. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines should contain a single integer — the number of paths for edge i
