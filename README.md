Top Data Structures –

Along with above algorithms, every computer science student is expected to implement below data structures –

Linked List Implementation | Part 1
Linked List Implementation | Part 2

Insertion in BST
Search given key in BST
Deletion from BST

Stack, Queue

Min Heap and Max Heap
